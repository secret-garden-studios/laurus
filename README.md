# Laurus

Laurus is an animation framework used to create 2D scenes from static images and SVGs. Anything in the scene, as well as the frame of the camera recording the scene, can be directed to move and/or transform via a web UI.

## About The Project

Laurus is closer to an instrument than it is to a tool or editor. To create a scene in Laurus, you must tinker with knobs, switches, and sliders until you become satisfied with a sequence of actions that typically is too complex to be foreseeable before coming to fruition.

Laurus is intended to provide us with gratification and a genuine sense of accomplishment in these modern times, when such feelings can be fleeting. Laurus was not made for profit; it was (and continues to be) made out of passion.

Laurus is available for limited public use at https://laurus.im. At this stage of the project, full access can be given by invitation only (due to the cost of running this type of platform).

***Built With***
React, Next.js.

## Gettting Started

This client is the only publicly available repository for the Laurus project at the moment, and is intended for visibility purposes only. Without access to the APIs or the rest of the code base, the usefulness of building the project locally is limited.
